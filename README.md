Forest fragmentation and rural complex model/maps for the congo basin 

Last update date: 03/05/2018
All code was developed by Giuseppe Molinario and Michael Humber.
The forest fragmentation maps scripts rely on the Landscape Fragmentation Tool, developed by Jason Parent, which uses ESRI arcpy libraries. Therefore the majority of all these scripts were developed using arcpy libraries as well. 

The script "runEntireProcess.py" is meant to run, the entire process, calling all the other necessary scripts. Comments within that script, and within the scripts called by it, explain what each chunk of code is actually doing.
